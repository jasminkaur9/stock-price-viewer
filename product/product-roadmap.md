# Roadmap

Building on: yfinance (data) + Plotly (charts) + Streamlit (UI)

## Sections

### 1. Data Collection & Display
Fetch daily OHLCV data from yfinance for a user-selected ticker and date range, display raw data in a table with key metrics (current price, change, high/low).

### 2. Interactive Price Chart
Plot daily prices using Plotly with candlestick and line chart options, range selector buttons (1M/3M/6M/YTD/1Y/All), volume subplot, and zoom/pan.

### 3. Enhancements
Add moving average overlays (SMA 20/50/200), multi-ticker comparison, and a downloadable CSV export.
